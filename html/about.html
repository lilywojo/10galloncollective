<h2> 10 Gallon Collective is band created from a collective love of good music, <br> art, and making lasting memories.
    Just a group of <br> best friends based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, <br> we were born from Saturday night improv sessions and spontaneous jams. <br>
    But what we like to do most is play our favorite songs live <br> in front of an awesome audience. Come see us at local Bethlehem <br> bars, restuarants, and breweries
to check us out! </h2>
